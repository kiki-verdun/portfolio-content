            I have cycled through many hobbies throughout my life, but the two that I have
            consistently returned to are reading and gaming. I am not picky about genres when
            it comes to games. I can have a lot of fun with a Spongebob plug-n-play game or a AAA horror game. 
            But the games that I've loved the most have included elements of life simulation.

            Animal Crossing and Rune Factory fit this description. Although Animal Crossing exploded in
            popularity in 2020, it made its debut on the Nintendo 64 in Japan in 2001 as Dobutsu no Mori,
            just two years after Harvest Moon 64 was released on the same console.
