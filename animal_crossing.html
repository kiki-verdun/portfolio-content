            Animal Crossing is one of Nintendo's most popular titles, behind Mario and Pok√©mon. Nintendo has released 
            an Animal Crossing title on every console since the Nintendo 64, demonstrating its continued popularity. 
        </p>
        <p><i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i> is my favorite and most-played video game of all-time, so I've included 
            screenshots of the my time with the game. I've also included images of the cover art for every Animal Crossing game.
