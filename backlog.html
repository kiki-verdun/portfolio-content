        I have a lot of games that I plan on playing, own, but have not gotten around to starting. Unsurprisingly, like both Animal
        Crossing and Rune Factory, these games have life-simulation or sandbox elements.

        I am fascinated and inspired by the types of things gamers build in Minecraft, but I have found it difficult to play due to 
        motion-sickness. I'm constantly trying to figure out how to make it work for me, to no avail. I am also interested in playing
         Fantasy Life on Nintendo 3DS, which also has life-sim elements.
